# Space Attack - Stop the Alien Invasion!

An iOS top-down spaceship shooter designed using the SpriteKit framework. Started as a learning project in order to educate myself with the SpriteKit framework. I eventually decided to take several more steps and release the project under my own LLC.

This project provided an environment for self-education:
-SpriteKit
-GameKit
-internationalization (includes spanish/chinese/japanese/german)
-in-app purchases
-working with lower-level sound library ObjectAL
-process for releasing applications on the App Store
-process for starting my own company and working directly with consultants


P.S.

After revisting this project several years later, I am able to see several bad practices that I have intentionally left untouched. The purpose for this is to provide myself and others with a timeline of my coding examples that demonstrates improvement.
