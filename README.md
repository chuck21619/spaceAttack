# Space Attack - Stop the Alien Invasion!

An iOS top-down spaceship shooter designed using the SpriteKit framework. Started as a learning project in order to educate myself with the SpriteKit framework. I eventually decided to take several more steps and release the project under my own LLC.

I have discontinued my apple developer account. This game is no longer available.

This project provided an environment to educate myself in the following:
- SpriteKit
- GameKit
- internationalization (includes spanish/chinese/japanese/german)
- in-app purchases
- dynamic ad insertion
- working with lower-level sound library ObjectAL
- process for releasing applications on the App Store
- process for starting my own company and working directly with consultants


P.S.
<br />After revisting this project several years later, I am able to see several bad practices that I have intentionally left untouched. The purpose for this is to provide myself and others with a timeline of my coding examples that demonstrates improvement.
